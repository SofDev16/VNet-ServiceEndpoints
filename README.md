# 🌐VNet-ServiceEndpoints


## 📘 Overview
Secure Azure PaaS resources by restricting access to a designated Virtual Network subnet using VNet Service Endpoints. This setup ensures that only approved network traffic from your VNet can access resources like Azure SQL Database or Storage, eliminating public‑internet exposure.

### 🧩 Key Tasks Completed
- Deployed an Azure VNet + Subnet with Service Endpoints enabled  
- Provisioned an Azure SQL Database with network rule limiting access to the subnet  
- Implemented Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform)  
- Validated connectivity from the web‑app subnet and blocked other traffic
